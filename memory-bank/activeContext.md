# Active Context - sBetterfy

## Current Work Focus
- **User Experience Improvements**: Enhanced error handling in the frontend with a flash message system across `dashboard.js`, `setup.js`, and `setup_spotify.js` for consistent API error display, aligning with the Flask template flash messages for uniform user feedback.
- **Core Functionality**: Stabilized credential setup by improving input validation and error handling for Spotify Developer credentials and Google Gemini AI API keys. Enabled playlist creation by fixing integration in `spotify_service.py` and confirming frontend functionality in `dashboard.js`.
- **Paused Testing**: As per user request, testing efforts are currently paused. The focus has shifted to other critical areas such as database management, security enhancements, performance optimization, and user experience improvements.

## Recent Changes
- **Alembic Configuration**: Successfully used `alembic stamp head` to mark the initial migration (`c1f3e8647134`) as applied, ensuring that future schema changes can be managed through Alembic without conflicts.
- **Security**: Implemented OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow in `spotify_service.py` to prevent authorization code interception, a significant security improvement for user authentication with Spotify.
- **User Experience**: Added flash messages to templates (`dashboard.html`, `setup_api.html`) for better user feedback on actions and errors. Enhanced frontend error handling with a consistent flash message system in `dashboard.js`, `setup.js`, and `setup_spotify.js`.
- **Credential Setup**: Updated `setup_spotify.js` and `setup.js` with robust input validation for Spotify credentials (Client ID and Secret) and Google Gemini AI API key. Improved error handling in `user_service.py` for credential storage with detailed feedback.
- **Playlist Creation**: Enhanced `spotify_service.py` to provide detailed feedback on playlist creation, ensuring proper error handling when adding tracks. Confirmed that `dashboard.js` already supports playlist saving with user feedback.
- **Performance**: Enhanced the caching mechanism in `spotify_service.py` to allow configurable expiration times for API requests, optimizing performance by minimizing redundant calls. Documented database performance considerations in `database.py` for future optimization.
- **Documentation**: Updated `progress.md` to reflect the current status of database migration, testing (paused), security (enhanced with PKCE), performance (initial caching optimization and database planning), user experience (enhanced error handling), and core functionality (credential setup and playlist creation).

## Next Steps
- **Recommendation Customization**: Implement additional parameters like tempo, energy, and popularity in `recommendation_service.py` and update the frontend in `dashboard.js` to allow users to customize recommendations further (Task 1.3 from build-roadmap.md).
- **Further Performance Optimization**: Continue optimizing API calls, database queries, and implementing additional caching strategies to further improve application performance. This includes reviewing other service interactions for efficiency (Task 3.1 from build-roadmap.md).
- **Database Schema Evolution**: With Alembic now aligned, any future database schema changes should be managed through migration scripts to maintain consistency and version control.
- **Documentation**: Continue to update Memory Bank files with any new decisions, patterns, or insights as work progresses in the above areas.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **User Experience Prioritization**: Improving UX with consistent error handling across all frontend components will make the application more accessible and user-friendly, which is essential for adoption and user retention.
- **Performance Prioritization**: With core functionality and security in place, further performance optimization will significantly impact user satisfaction and should be continued.
- **Roadmap Focus**: Following the build-roadmap.md, prioritize core functionality and user experience tasks to achieve a robust MVP for v1.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Modular Architecture**: Continue to follow a modular approach with Flask blueprints for API and authentication endpoints, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- **Database Management**: Use Alembic for all future database schema changes to maintain a clear history and avoid manual schema modifications.
- **Security**: Maintain high security standards with implementations like PKCE for OAuth flows to protect user data.
- **Performance**: Optimize caching and API interactions to ensure efficient data retrieval and minimize load on external services. Plan for database scalability to handle future growth.
- **User Experience**: Ensure consistent user feedback mechanisms like flash messages across both backend templates and frontend JavaScript for a seamless user experience.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed and up-to-date documentation in the Memory Bank to ensure continuity and clarity after memory resets.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Migration Conflicts**: Learned that direct database creation via SQLAlchemy can conflict with Alembic migrations. Using `stamp` to align migration history is a practical solution to integrate existing schemas into Alembic's tracking system.
- **User-Driven Prioritization**: The user's request to pause testing highlights the importance of flexibility in development focus, adapting to immediate needs or concerns over a predefined roadmap.
- **Security Implementation**: Implementing PKCE for OAuth 2.0 flow requires careful handling of code verifiers and challenges, ensuring they are correctly generated, stored, and used during token exchange to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhancing caching mechanisms with configurable expiration times allows for tailored performance improvements based on the nature of data being fetched, balancing freshness with efficiency. Documenting future database optimization strategies ensures preparedness for scalability challenges.
- **User Experience Enhancement**: Implementing a consistent flash message system in the frontend for API errors ensures uniform user feedback, aligning with backend flash messages and improving overall usability.
- **Credential Validation**: Robust input validation for credentials and API keys prevents user errors during setup, improving the onboarding experience.
- **Playlist Creation Feedback**: Detailed feedback during playlist creation ensures users are informed about the success or failure of operations, enhancing trust and usability.
