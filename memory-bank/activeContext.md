# Active Context - sBetterfy

## Current Work Focus
- **User Experience Improvements**: Enhanced error handling in the frontend with a flash message system across multiple components (`dashboard.js`, `setup.js`, `setup_spotify.js`) for consistent API error display, aligning with the Flask template flash messages for uniform user feedback. Added a new section in the dashboard for filter extreme suggestions to guide users on their first visit, now made interactive with the ability to apply filters directly.
- **Performance Optimization**: Initial performance optimization for API request caching has been completed. The caching mechanism in `spotify_service.py` now supports granular control over expiration times, reducing redundant API calls. Additionally, performance optimization considerations for the database have been documented in `database.py`, planning for future scalability.
- **Paused Testing**: As per user request, testing efforts are currently paused. The focus has shifted to other critical areas such as database management, security enhancements, performance optimization, and user experience improvements.

## Recent Changes
- **Alembic Configuration**: Successfully used `alembic stamp head` to mark the initial migration (`c1f3e8647134`) as applied, ensuring that future schema changes can be managed through Alembic without conflicts.
- **Security**: Implemented OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow in `spotify_service.py` to prevent authorization code interception, a significant security improvement for user authentication with Spotify.
- **User Experience**: Added flash messages to templates (`dashboard.html`, `setup_api.html`) for better user feedback on actions and errors. Enhanced frontend error handling with a consistent flash message system in `dashboard.js`, `setup.js`, and `setup_spotify.js`. Updated `dashboard.html` and `dashboard.js` to include a new panel for filter extreme suggestions to improve user onboarding, now with interactive "Apply this Filter" buttons to directly set filter values.
- **Performance**: Enhanced the caching mechanism in `spotify_service.py` to allow configurable expiration times for API requests, optimizing performance by minimizing redundant calls. Documented database performance considerations in `database.py` for future optimization.
- **Documentation**: Updated `progress.md` to reflect the current status of database migration, testing (paused), security (enhanced with PKCE), performance (initial caching optimization and database planning), and user experience (enhanced error handling and interactive filter suggestions) aspects of the project. Updated `activeContext.md` to document recent UI enhancements.

## Next Steps
- **Further User Experience Improvements**: Continue enhancing UI/UX by refining other frontend components for a more intuitive user journey. Consider adding more detailed tooltips or help sections to explain filter impacts and recommendation parameters.
- **Further Performance Optimization**: Continue optimizing API calls, database queries, and implementing additional caching strategies to further improve application performance. This includes reviewing other service interactions for efficiency.
- **Database Schema Evolution**: With Alembic now aligned, any future database schema changes should be managed through migration scripts to maintain consistency and version control.
- **Documentation**: Continue to update Memory Bank files with any new decisions, patterns, or insights as work progresses in the above areas.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **User Experience Prioritization**: Improving UX with consistent error handling across all frontend components and introducing interactive onboarding features like filter suggestions will make the application more accessible and user-friendly, which is essential for adoption and user retention.
- **Performance Prioritization**: With core functionality and security in place, further performance optimization will significantly impact user satisfaction and should be continued.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Modular Architecture**: Continue to follow a modular approach with Flask blueprints for API and authentication endpoints, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- **Database Management**: Use Alembic for all future database schema changes to maintain a clear history and avoid manual schema modifications.
- **Security**: Maintain high security standards with implementations like PKCE for OAuth flows to protect user data.
- **Performance**: Optimize caching and API interactions to ensure efficient data retrieval and minimize load on external services. Plan for database scalability to handle future growth.
- **User Experience**: Ensure consistent user feedback mechanisms like flash messages across both backend templates and frontend JavaScript for a seamless user experience. Introduce interactive onboarding aids like filter suggestions to guide new users.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed and up-to-date documentation in the Memory Bank to ensure continuity and clarity after memory resets.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Migration Conflicts**: Learned that direct database creation via SQLAlchemy can conflict with Alembic migrations. Using `stamp` to align migration history is a practical solution to integrate existing schemas into Alembic's tracking system.
- **User-Driven Prioritization**: The user's request to pause testing highlights the importance of flexibility in development focus, adapting to immediate needs or concerns over a predefined roadmap.
- **Security Implementation**: Implementing PKCE for OAuth 2.0 flow requires careful handling of code verifiers and challenges, ensuring they are correctly generated, stored, and used during token exchange to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhancing caching mechanisms with configurable expiration times allows for tailored performance improvements based on the nature of data being fetched, balancing freshness with efficiency. Documenting future database optimization strategies ensures preparedness for scalability challenges.
- **User Experience Enhancement**: Implementing a consistent flash message system in the frontend for API errors ensures uniform user feedback, aligning with backend flash messages and improving overall usability. Adding interactive filter extreme suggestions helps new users understand and apply filter impacts directly, enhancing onboarding.
