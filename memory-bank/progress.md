# Progress Tracker for sBetterfy

## Date of Last Update
June 14, 2025

## What Works
The following components and features of 'sBetterfy' are currently functional based on the analysis and recent enhancements:

- **Core Application (Flask)**: The main application logic in 'main.py' successfully handles routing, session management, and API endpoints for user authentication and interaction.
- **Spotify Integration**: 'spotify_service.py' effectively manages Spotify API interactions, including authentication, token refresh, fetching user data (liked songs, profile), creating playlists, and searching tracks. Now includes an in-memory caching mechanism for GET requests to reduce API call latency.
- **Recommendation Engine**: 'recommendation_service.py' generates music recommendations using Google Gemini AI, with verification of tracks via Spotify search, based on user preferences.
- **User Data Management**: 'user_service.py' securely stores and retrieves sensitive user data (Spotify credentials, tokens, API keys) using Fernet encryption.
- **Database**: 'database.py' initializes and manages a SQLite database to store user information.
- **Onboarding Process**: 'setup_spotify.html' and 'setup_api.html' provide a seamless onboarding experience with guided tutorials for setting up Spotify Developer credentials and Google Gemini AI API keys.
- **Security Enhancements**: Secure session cookies are configured in 'main.py' with 'Secure', 'HttpOnly', and 'SameSite=Strict' attributes to protect against session hijacking and CSRF attacks.
- **Key Management**: Updated 'user_service.py' to use a local key file 'dev_master_key.txt' as a fallback for encryption keys if the environment variable is not set, enhancing security for development environments.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation added to critical API endpoints in 'main.py' ('/api/recommendations', '/api/save-spotify-creds', '/api/save-api-key', '/api/create-playlist') with checks for type, length, and format to prevent abuse and ensure reliability.
- **Security Documentation**: Created 'docs/security-guidelines.md' with detailed security protocols, encryption methods, and best practices to guide secure development and maintenance of the project.

## What's Left to Build
The following proposed improvements and features are yet to be implemented, as outlined in the project brief:

- **Advanced Security Enhancements**: Conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities (Task 1.3 pending).
- **Performance Optimizations**: Run performance benchmarking script to establish baseline metrics (Task 2.4 partially completed, script and plan created).
- **Code Maintainability**: Completed Task 3.1 by restructuring 'main.py' using Flask blueprints for better routing modularity, creating 'blueprints/auth.py' for authentication routes and 'blueprints/api.py' for API routes, and registering them in 'main.py'. Remaining tasks include enhancing error handling with specific exception types and improving code documentation with detailed docstrings and comments.
- **User Experience Improvements**: Provide more descriptive feedback in API responses for better user guidance in the UI, and extend recommendation customization with additional parameters like tempo or energy.
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Introduce database migration tools like Alembic for schema evolution and develop a comprehensive test suite for reliability and refactoring support.
- **Automation and CI/CD**: Set up automated testing and deployment pipelines to enforce coding standards and streamline development processes.

## Current Status of Features
- **Spotify Authentication**: Fully functional. Users can authenticate with Spotify and save credentials securely.
- **Recommendation Generation**: Functional with basic customization (genres, moods, discovery level, year range, popularity). Advanced customization options are pending.
- **Playlist Creation**: Functional. Users can create playlists with recommended tracks via Spotify API.
- **User Data Encryption**: Functional with improved key management. Credentials and tokens are encrypted using Fernet, with a fallback to a local key file for development.
- **Onboarding UI**: Fully functional with guided setup for Spotify and Google AI API keys.
- **Session Security**: Enhanced with secure cookie attributes; no further immediate action required.
- **Input Validation**: Implemented comprehensively across critical API endpoints ('/api/recommendations', '/api/save-spotify-creds', '/api/save-api-key', '/api/create-playlist'); no immediate further action required for these endpoints.
- **Testing Framework**: Not started. No test suite currently exists.
- **Database Optimization**: Not started. Indexes and migration support are pending.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Not started. Automation for testing and deployment is pending.

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Error Handling**: Current error handling in various modules (e.g., 'recommendation_service.py') is broad and may not provide specific enough feedback for debugging or user experience. Granular exception handling is needed.
- **Performance**: Without caching, frequent Spotify API calls can lead to latency, especially during recommendation generation. Database queries may slow down as user data grows due to lack of indexes.
- **Scalability**: The SQLite database may not scale well with a large user base; future consideration for a more robust database solution may be necessary.
- **Security**: While session security is enhanced, the encryption key management relies on environment variables, which could be a vulnerability in production environments.
- **Recommendation Accuracy**: The AI-generated recommendations depend on the quality of prompts and parsing logic in 'recommendation_service.py', which may need refinement for better accuracy or handling of edge cases (e.g., failed JSON parsing).
- **Testing**: Absence of a test suite means potential regressions or bugs may go unnoticed until user interaction.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Analysis (June 14, 2025)**: Conducted a thorough review of project files ('main.py', 'spotify_service.py', 'recommendation_service.py', 'user_service.py', 'database.py') to understand the structure and functionality of 'sBetterfy'. Identified key areas for improvement including security, performance, and maintainability.
- **Planning Phase**: Proposed a comprehensive improvement plan covering security enhancements, performance optimizations, code maintainability, user experience, technical debt reduction, and CI/CD automation. Special focus was placed on creating a seamless onboarding process for Spotify and Google Gemini AI API setup.
- **User Feedback on Onboarding**: User emphasized the need for a frictionless onboarding process, which was verified to already exist in the setup templates, aligning with the proposed plan.
- **Implementation of Security and Validation**: Prioritized immediate security enhancements by configuring secure session cookies and adding input validation to the recommendations endpoint in 'main.py' to address critical vulnerabilities and reliability concerns.
- **Documentation and Memory Bank Initialization**: Created 'docs/ai_swe_guidelines.json' to enforce disciplined development practices. Initialized the 'memory-bank/' directory with 'project-brief.md' to summarize discussions and 'README.md' to outline its purpose. User requested further initialization and tracking, leading to this 'progress.md' file.
- **Decision to Track Progress**: Following user feedback, decided to create a detailed progress tracker to monitor completed tasks, pending features, issues, and decision history, ensuring transparency and continuity in project development.
- **Security Enhancements (Phase 1)**: Completed Tasks 1.1, 1.2, and 1.4 from the roadmap by implementing a fallback mechanism for encryption keys in 'user_service.py' using a local file 'dev_master_key.txt' (excluded from version control via '.gitignore'), adding comprehensive input validation to critical API endpoints in 'main.py', and documenting security practices in 'docs/security-guidelines.md' to guide secure development.
- **Performance Optimization (Phase 2)**: Completed Task 2.1 by implementing an in-memory caching mechanism in 'spotify_service.py' for Spotify API GET requests, reducing latency for frequently accessed data like user profiles and liked songs. Completed Task 2.2 by implementing batch processing in 'recommendation_service.py' for Spotify search requests during recommendation verification, reducing API call overhead. Completed Task 2.3 by adding an index on the 'id' field in the 'users' table in 'database.py' to improve query performance for user lookups. Partially completed Task 2.4 by creating 'memory-bank/performance-metrics.md' with a detailed benchmarking plan and script to establish baseline metrics for key operations.
- **Code Maintainability (Phase 3)**: Completed Task 3.1 by restructuring 'main.py' to use Flask blueprints for better routing modularity, creating 'blueprints/auth.py' for authentication-related routes and 'blueprints/api.py' for API-related routes, and registering these blueprints in 'main.py'.

This document will be updated regularly to reflect the latest status, issues, and decisions as the 'sBetterfy' project evolves.
