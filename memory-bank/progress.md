# Project Progress - sBetterfy

## Current Status
- **Database Migration**: Alembic migration tracking has been aligned with the existing database schema. The initial migration (`c1f3e8647134`) has been stamped as applied, resolving conflicts with the pre-existing `users` table. Future schema changes can now be managed through Alembic migrations.
- **Testing**: Testing efforts have been paused as per user request. Previous test runs identified issues with Fernet key formatting and endpoint naming in blueprints, which remain unresolved.
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow for Spotify authentication has been implemented to enhance security. Basic security measures were already in place, and this advanced enhancement is now complete.
- **Performance**: Initial performance optimization for API request caching has been implemented. The caching mechanism in `spotify_service.py` now supports granular control over expiration times, reducing redundant API calls. Additionally, performance optimization considerations for the database have been documented in `database.py`, planning for future scalability.
- **User Experience**: UI/UX improvements for the dashboard and setup process are partially implemented. Flash messages have been added to templates for better user feedback. Error handling in the frontend has been enhanced with a consistent flash message system across `dashboard.js`, `setup.js`, and `setup_spotify.js`. A new panel for filter extreme suggestions has been added to `dashboard.html` and `dashboard.js` to guide users on their first visit, now made interactive with "Apply this Filter" buttons to directly set filter values.

## What Works
- **Core Functionality**: User authentication, Spotify credential storage, and basic API interactions are functional.
- **Database Setup**: SQLite database is operational with the `users` table for storing user data and credentials.
- **Alembic Configuration**: Alembic is now correctly set up to manage future database schema changes.
- **Security Enhancement**: OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow is implemented for Spotify authentication, providing an additional layer of security against authorization code interception.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced caching for API requests with configurable expiration times, improving performance by minimizing redundant calls to Spotify API. Database performance considerations are documented for future optimization.
- **User Experience**: Flash messages in templates and a consistent flash message system in the frontend (`dashboard.js`, `setup.js`, `setup_spotify.js`) provide clear user feedback for actions and errors. Interactive filter extreme suggestions on the dashboard help new users understand and apply filter impacts directly.

## What's Left to Build
- **Further Performance Optimization**: Continue optimizing API calls, database queries, and additional caching strategies to further improve application performance.
- **User Experience**: Enhance UI/UX by adding more detailed tooltips or help sections to explain filter impacts and recommendation parameters. Refine other frontend components for a more intuitive setup process.
- **Testing**: Resolve test failures related to Fernet key issues, endpoint naming in blueprints, and service method mismatches (paused as per user request).
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.
- **Documentation**: Expand technical documentation for API endpoints, database schema, and security protocols.

## Known Issues
- **Fernet Key**: The encryption key in `dev_master_key.txt` needs to be correctly formatted for Fernet encryption to resolve test failures in `UserService`.
- **Blueprint Endpoints**: Test failures indicate endpoint naming issues in blueprints (e.g., `url_for('login')` vs. `url_for('auth.login')`), requiring updates to templates or test configurations.
- **Testing Paused**: Further testing and resolution of test failures are on hold as per user request.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Database Migration**: Initially, the database was created directly via SQLAlchemy, leading to conflicts with Alembic migrations. The decision to use `alembic stamp head` aligns migration tracking with the current schema, enabling future schema evolution through Alembic.
- **Testing Strategy**: Testing was initially a focus to ensure functionality, but due to user request, the focus has shifted to other development areas like database management and security enhancements.
- **Security Focus**: The implementation of OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow for Spotify authentication marks a significant step in enhancing security, addressing concerns about authorization code interception, especially for public clients or single-page applications.
- **Performance Strategy**: Enhancing the caching mechanism for API requests allows for better control over data freshness and reduces load on external APIs. Documenting database performance considerations prepares for future scalability and optimization needs.
- **User Experience Strategy**: Implementing a consistent flash message system in the frontend ensures that API errors are communicated to users in a uniform manner, improving the overall user experience. Adding interactive filter extreme suggestions on the dashboard provides practical examples and direct application options to help users understand filter impacts during onboarding.
