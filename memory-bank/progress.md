# Project Progress - sBetterfy

## Current Status
- **Database Migration**: Alembic migration tracking has been aligned with the existing database schema. The initial migration (`c1f3e8647134`) has been stamped as applied, resolving conflicts with the pre-existing `users` table. Future schema changes can now be managed through Alembic migrations.
- **Testing**: Testing efforts have been paused as per user request. Previous test runs identified issues with Fernet key formatting and endpoint naming in blueprints, which remain unresolved.
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow for Spotify authentication has been implemented to enhance security. Basic security measures were already in place, and this advanced enhancement is now complete.
- **Performance**: Initial performance optimization for API request caching has been implemented. The caching mechanism in `spotify_service.py` now supports granular control over expiration times, reducing redundant API calls. Additionally, performance optimization considerations for the database have been documented in `database.py`, planning for future scalability.
- **User Experience**: UI/UX improvements for the dashboard and setup process are partially implemented. Flash messages have been added to templates for better user feedback. Error handling in the frontend has been enhanced with a flash message system across `dashboard.js`, `setup.js`, and `setup_spotify.js` for consistent API error display.
- **Core Functionality**: Credential setup has been stabilized with robust input validation and improved error handling for Spotify Developer credentials and Google Gemini AI API keys. Playlist creation functionality is fully enabled with detailed feedback in `spotify_service.py` and confirmed frontend support in `dashboard.js`.

## What Works
- **Core Functionality**: User authentication, Spotify credential storage, and basic API interactions are functional. Playlist creation is now fully integrated, allowing users to save AI-generated recommendations as Spotify playlists.
- **Database Setup**: SQLite database is operational with the `users` table for storing user data and credentials.
- **Alembic Configuration**: Alembic is now correctly set up to manage future database schema changes.
- **Security Enhancement**: OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow is implemented for Spotify authentication, providing an additional layer of security against authorization code interception.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced caching for API requests with configurable expiration times, improving performance by minimizing redundant calls to Spotify API. Database performance considerations are documented for future optimization.
- **User Experience**: Flash messages in templates and a consistent flash message system in the frontend (`dashboard.js`, `setup.js`, `setup_spotify.js`) provide clear user feedback for actions and errors. Credential setup includes input validation for a smoother onboarding process.

## What's Left to Build
- **Recommendation Customization**: Implement additional parameters like tempo, energy, and popularity in `recommendation_service.py` and update the frontend in `dashboard.js` to allow users to customize recommendations further (Task 1.3 from build-roadmap.md).
- **Further Performance Optimization**: Continue optimizing API calls, database queries, and additional caching strategies to further improve application performance (Task 3.1 from build-roadmap.md).
- **Testing**: Resolve test failures related to Fernet key issues, endpoint naming in blueprints, and service method mismatches (paused as per user request).
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.
- **Documentation**: Expand technical documentation for API endpoints, database schema, and security protocols.
